    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Sourdough is the OG method of baking bread. Before the development of dry yeast, bakers had to cultivate
        starter by mixing flour and water, and allowing wild yeast to populate it, causing the mixture to rise.
        The resulting fermentation yields a bread that is more robust in flavor, in structure, and far surpasses
        other breads in nutritional value. My fiance bakes sourdough often, we have a jar of starter that we have
        maintained for 3 months at time of writing. After it produced its first good loaf, we named it "Misha".

    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Active Starter 100g</li>
        <li>Bread Flour 425g</li>
        <li>Einkorn Flour 75g</li>
        <li>Water 340g</li>
        <li>Salt 10g</li>
        <li>Malt Powder 10g</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix active starter and lukewarm water. Whisk it until milky consistency.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and malt powder to the starter and water mixture. 
            Mix together until dough looks shaggy.</li>
        <li>Cover dough with a damp towel, and leave to rest for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Begin process of folding dough. Perform 3 sets of "stretch and folds", 30 minutes apart.</li>
        <li>Now 3 sets of "coil folds", also 30 minutes apart.</li>
        <li>Let dough bulk rise for 5 to 12 hours (depending on the temperature), or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Once doubled in size, place dough on a lightly floured surface ad shape it by rotating the ball of dough,
            and pulling it towards you. Leave it to rest again for 60 to 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. While preheating, score the dough with your preferred designs.</li>
        <li>Place dough into a dutch oven, covered, bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove bread from the dutch oven, and put it back in the oven to bake for another 10 minutes.</li>
        <le>After removing from the oven again, let the bread rest for 1 hour before cutting.</le>
    </ol>
